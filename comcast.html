	<div class="work-intro">Needing multiple platforms for managing their employees’ access to products and services left Comcast Business customers frustrated and more likely to contact support. Combining these platforms into a single user management portal changed that.</div>

  	<div class="summary-title">Problem</div>
  	<div class="prob-sol-copy">Each service Comcast Business offered was siloed in its own platform, requiring business managers to visit multiple portals to manage their employee’s access to services. Customers found this inefficient, leading to decreased satisfaction and increased calls to customer support, motivating Comcast to make a change.</div>
  <div class="summary-title">Solution</div>
  	<div class="prob-sol-copy">I merged these portals into a single platform that took a holistic approach to user management, creating a comprehensive view of a user’s role, access and privileges. I created multiple iterations of the experience, introducing features over time in line with technical timelines.</div>

	<h1 class="heading-2">The current experience was inconsistent </h1>
	<div class="work-text"><b>In the current state, each service portal had it's own visual style and information hierarchy, creating navigation issues and increased cognitive load.</b> User's couldn't depend on knowing where to look in each service portal for a specific action or piece of information. Some information, like name or email address, was listed in multiple places and there was no way to make changes on a system level, making it tedious for manager's to update and the potential for data inconsistency.</div>

	<div class="work-text">It was  user profile would make it easy for users to know where to go to if they needed to change a setting, but I had to make sure that they weren’t overwhelmed by trying to find what they needed when they got there. <b>Research showed that many users weren’t visiting the portal frequently, so it was important that the UI minimized their cognitive load and made actions and information plainly visible at all times.</b> In practice, this meant having clear and consistent titles for tabs, settings that were easy to find when scanning and links and buttons labeled with copy that clearly stated the action being taken. </div>

<div class="work-text-section">
	<h1 class="heading-2">A single workflow for creating every user</h1>
	<div class="work-text">Managers found creating new user accounts tedious, having to go through multiple sign-up flows for each service they assigned. This often meant that full access was granted over multiple sessions or might not be completed. I combined these flows into a single, multi-step process that focused on presenting tasks in focused segments that didn’t overwhelm users. A visible timeline kept managers aware of their progress, decreasing abandonment. </div>

	<h1 class="heading-2">Let users skip the profile</h1>
	<div class="work-text">Entries in the user directory were information dense, going beyond their name and contact info to include the access and role they had in regard to services. Frequently used actions for managers, like deactivating a user or resetting their password were accessible from a dropdown menu.</div>

	<h1 class="heading-2">Multi-Phase Approach</h1>
	<div class="work-text">Enabling the large-scale changes in user management necessitated switching to a new back-end architecture, which was complex and would take an unknown amount of time. To accommodate this, I created multiple iterations of the experience that phased in new features (like an expanded user role structure over time) that could be implemented as back-end updates were made.  </div>
