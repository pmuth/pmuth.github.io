			<div class="caseBody">For the 2015 NCAA Final Four, Coca Cola & Ogilvy NY built a Coke Zero campaign around the idea of "Drinkable Advertising". Using the Shazam app on their phones, users were able to digitally interact with different types of traditional advertising and simulate the experience of drinking a Coke Zero and win a free soda in the process.</div> 

			<div class="caseBody">Bossa NYC was tasked with bringing these ideas to life by fleshing out the concepts and building the digital aspects of the campaign.</div>

			<div class="caseBody">I was involved from the beginning, working with the creative director and the creative technologist to determine the best way to execute each of these ideas. I partnered with the lead UX designer and designed user flows, wireframes and prototypes for the TV ad, kiosk and campaign home page. </div>

			<div class="caseBody">During the Final Four, I traveled with the team to Indianapolis to assist with the execution, setting up the interactives kiosks at the Circle Centre Mall and helping guide users through the experience.</div>

			<div class="caseBody finalParagraph">Users loved the campaign, as it was the <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/06/04/anatomy-ad-behind-scenes-coke-zero-s-drinkable-advertising-campaign">most “Shazamed” advertisement in the company’s history</a>. The Coke Zero coupons were redeemed at a rate of 25%, which exceeded expectations. At the 2015 Cannes Lions festival, the campaign won a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912005543/https://social.ogilvy.com/global-showing-in-cannes-lions-wins/">Bronze medal</a>.</div>
