			<div class="caseSubtitle">For the 2015 NCAA Final Four, Coca Cola & Ogilvy NY built a Coke Zero campaign around the idea of "Drinkable Advertising". Using the Shazam app on their phones, users would be able to digitally interact with different types of traditional advertising and simulate the experience of drinking a Coke Zero, winning a free soda in the process.</div>
			

			<div class="caseBody">Mother New York approached Bossa about creating a series of photo booths that would capture guests as they interacted with three installations scattered throughout the event. They wanted guests to have instant access to their photos and videos, so that they could share them on social media as quickly as possible.</div>
