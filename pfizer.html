					<p>In 2017, Pfizer launched Pfizer Oncology Together to provide patients with access to dedicated counselors, who would assist them over the phone with finding resources for financial assistance, emotional support, and other day-to-day challenges of having cancer, such as finding transportation or lodging when receiving out of town treatment.</b>.
					</p>
					<p>Patients and Purpose was tasked with creating an online presence in two phases;</p>

				<p><b>It was clear from our research and analysis that the common thread among all user groups was that they needed to be able to access information quickly and reliably, either because they were in a stressful situation (patients/caregivers) or because they had limited time (healthcare professionals)</b>. This meant that the site needed a sign-up system that was quick and flexible to the needs of different users. <b>As a result, I focused on progressive registration and giving user multiple ways to sign up</b>.</p>

				<p>Initially, the client saw user registration as an all or nothing proposition. If patients wanted access to any of the program’s features, from periodic informational e-mails, all the way to access to a personal telephone concierge, they would need to fill out a lengthy form that required not only personal contact information, but also particulars about their cancer diagnosis and treatment. <b>We realized quickly that this would be a heavy burden on the user and greatly decrease the chances that they would sign-up for anything at all</b>.</p>

				<p>In response, <b>I created a progressive registration system, where users would be able to engage with the program at the level that they wanted and only have to provide the necessary amount of information</b>	. There were three levels;</p>

				<p>Dealing with cancer is obviously a stressful situation, so we wanted to make our users as comfort as possible with registration. <b>In addition to web sign-up, we offered a toll-free phone number that users could call so that they could ask any questions they wanted before joining the program</b>. Representatives would then be able to sign them up over the phone.</p>

				<p>However, calling customer support creates extra friction for users, as they might be wary of having to wait on hold for an unknown amount of time. <b>To ease this concern, we created a third option. Prominently displayed in the header of every page, a callout invited users to request a call from a representative in as little as an hour simply by providing their name and telephone number</b>. This provided user’s with the ease of web sign-up, while providing the comfort of being taken care of by a live representative.</p>

				<p>The “Tasks” page is the hub of the experience, where a user can see at a glance the members of their network, all of the tasks that need to be completed, future appointments and new notifications.</p>
				<p>All of this content was organized using a card system, which provided flexibility in how much information could be provided and allowed users to take actions without having to leave the page.
